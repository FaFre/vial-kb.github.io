# Version 0.5

Vial version 0.5 is currently in pre-release testing.

## Dynamic Key Overrides

The Dynamic Key Overrides feature allows configuring QMK Key Overrides in the Vial UI. This feature lets you override a modifier-key combination to send a different modifier-key combination. More documentation is available on the [QMK website](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_key_overrides).

## Complex Macro Keycodes

The redesigned macro UI allows you to easily assign arbitrary QMK keycodes to macros, including things such as layer keycodes, backlight or RGB operations, and QMK behavior toggles:
