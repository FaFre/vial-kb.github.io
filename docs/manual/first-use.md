### Linux
Unpackage the download and launch the `Vial` executable.

If you discover any bugs please [raise an issue](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-gui/issues/new/choose).

## 3. Program your new keyboard

Using Vial is extremely simple, just click on a key you would like to change the value of in the top palette then select your replacement key or macro in the bottom palette.

Your new key will be automatically saved onto the keyboard and immediately ready for use.
